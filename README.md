# Project Title

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for


## Problem Statement & Objective
Frontline teams at United Airlines are responsible for ensuring every flight departs on time and is operationally ready. However, not all flights are equally easy to manage. Certain flights pose greater complexity due to factors such as limited ground time, higher volumes of checked or carry-on baggage, and specific customer service needs that often increase with passenger load.
Currently, identifying these high-difficulty flights relies heavily on personal experience and local team knowledge. This manual approach is inconsistent, non-scalable, and risks missing opportunities for proactive resource planning across the airport.
To address this, you are tasked with developing a Flight Difficulty Score that systematically quantifies the relative complexity of each flight using the datasets provided, which span two weeks of departures from Chicago O‚ÄôHare International Airport (ORD).

The goal is to design a data-driven framework that:

- Calculates a Flight Difficulty Score for each flight using flight-level, customer, and station-level data.
- Identifies the primary operational drivers contributing to flight difficulty to enable proactive planning and optimized resource allocation.
## Approach Overview

Our solution is structured into three main stages:

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
We examined two weeks of ORD flight data to uncover operational patterns:
- Average delay and % late departures  
- Flights with ground time below minimum turn threshold  
- Transfer-to-checked bag ratios  
- Load factor vs. delay correlation  
- Relationship between special service requests and delays  

### 2. Flight Difficulty Score Development
We built a **data-driven scoring model** that resets daily:
- **Feature categories:**
  - Ground time shortfall  
  - Passenger load & service needs  
  - Baggage handling complexity  
  - Flight- and aircraft-level attributes
- **Scoring:** Each flight is assigned a daily normalized score (0‚Äì100)  
- **Ranking:** Flights are ranked by difficulty per day  
- **Classification:** Flights grouped into:
  - üü• Difficult (Top 33%)  
  - üü® Medium (Middle 34%)  
  - üü© Easy (Bottom 33%)

### 3. Operational Insights
We analyzed the most common causes of operational complexity and identified airports and routes that consistently pose higher challenges.  
Key recommendations include optimizing staffing for tight-turn flights, prioritizing high-SSR flights and proactive baggage planning.

## Scoring Steps

1. Normalize all features (Min-Max 0‚Äì1 scaling).  
2. Apply category weights to create composite difficulty score.  
3. Scale final score to **0‚Äì100** for interpretability.  
4. Rank flights *within each day* (highest = most difficult).  
5. Classify into **Difficult / Medium / Easy** using percentile thresholds.

## Destination Difficulty Analysis (from SkyHack-30-2025-Submission.pdf)

**Top 5 Difficult Destinations:**

| Rank | Airport | Difficulty % | Avg Score | Flights |
|------|----------|--------------|------------|----------|
| 1Ô∏è‚É£ | **GRU** (S√£o Paulo) | 100% | 37.16 | 15 |
| 2Ô∏è‚É£ | **BRU** (Brussels) | 100% | 37.08 | 15 |
| 3Ô∏è‚É£ | **FRA** (Frankfurt) | 100% | 31.47 | 30 |
| 4Ô∏è‚É£ | **HNL** (Honolulu) | 100% | 31.44 | 15 |
| 5Ô∏è‚É£ | **ATH** (Athens) | 100% | 31.35 | 15 |

**Additional High-Difficulty Destinations:**  
HND (Tokyo), CDG (Paris), PUJ (Punta Cana), ORF (Norfolk), ONT (Ontario)


üóùÔ∏è *Pattern:*  
- International and long-haul routes show consistently higher operational complexity.  
- Domestic high-tourist routes (e.g., HNL, ORF) also face elevated ground-time and service challenges.
## Key Insights (from SkyHack-30-2025-Submission.pdf)

- ~38% of flights departed later than scheduled.  
- Flights with <10 min buffer below minimum turn were **2√ó more likely** to be delayed.  
- **Baggage volume** and **transfer ratio** were the **top complexity drivers** (2‚Äì3√ó increase in difficult flights).  
- **Special service requests (SSRs)** strongly correlated with higher difficulty.  
- ‚ÄúDifficult‚Äù flights accounted for **65%+ of total delay minutes**.
